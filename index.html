                            Social stratification plays a crucial role in determining how structural barriers and societal institutions in the personal, private, and professional social sectors limit an individual's socioeconomic trajectory in society. This stratification, influenced by several ascribed and achieved social characteristics, significantly impacts an individual's social mobility. For minority populations, this often means an increasing amount of social vulnerability due to socioeconomic stratification, racism, and inequality. Social stratification effectively confines minority populations to specific social outcomes and characteristic patterns, such as federal, state, or local trends, that can provide statistically significant correlations to the relationship between social vulnerability and residential region.

                                The hypothesis builds upon the literature by addressing key themes related to social vulnerability, socioeconomic inequality, and the structural barriers marginalized populations face, especially in Puerto Rico. The literature emphasizes the disproportionate impact of natural disasters like Hurricane Maria on Puerto Ricans, highlighting migration dynamics, climate-induced displacement, housing insecurity, and economic pressures on marginalized communities (Acosta et al., 2020; Negrón et al., 2024; Rivera, 2020). These studies outline the importance of understanding the demographic and socioeconomic factors contributing to vulnerability, such as migration, income inequality, and limited access to resources.

                                The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), developed by the CDC, is a tool used to identify communities that may need more help during disasters like hurricanes, floods, or pandemics. It looks at factors like income, education, housing, and access to healthcare to determine a community's vulnerability. The higher the score, the more vulnerable the community is to harm during a disaster. The American Community Survey (ACS) is a survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau that collects detailed information about people’s lives, such as their income, education, employment, and housing. This information assists in understanding the needs of different communities and guides decisions about where to direct resources and services. PUMA stands for Public Use Microdata Areas, which are geographic areas used to report census data. These areas are smaller than counties and are designed to provide more detailed and localized information. PUMA often breaks down the data from the ACS to give a clearer picture of what is happening in specific neighborhoods or regions.

                                The analysis employed linear regression models to examine the relationship between the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) average score (sviAVG.score) and two independent variables: employment status (employment status) and education attainment (education). The first model (Model 1) assessed the direct effects of employment status and education level on the SVI score. Specifically, it used the formula sviAVG.score ~ employment.stat + education to evaluate how each variable individually influences the SVI score. The second model (Model 2) incorporated an interaction term between education and employment status, using the formula sviAVG.score ~ education * employment.stat. This model aimed to test for moderation, exploring whether the relationship between education level and the SVI score differs depending on employment status. By including interaction terms, Model 2 allowed for an assessment of how the effect of education on the SVI score might be moderated by whether an individual is employed or unemployed, providing deeper insights into how these variables may influence each other in the context of social vulnerability. Both models were applied to data from the analysisPOP dataset.

                                The results from Model 1 indicate that employment status significantly affects the SVI score, with unemployed individuals showing a higher average SVI score. The coefficient for Unemployed is positive and statistically significant, suggesting that being unemployed is associated with increased social vulnerability. However, the direct effects of education level on the SVI score are less clear. The coefficient for educationHigh School Graduate is very small and statistically insignificant, indicating no meaningful effect. Similarly, the negative coefficients for educationSome College and educationCollege Graduate suggest that higher levels of education are associated with slightly lower SVI scores, but these effects are also small and lack strong significance.

                                In contrast, Model 2, which includes interaction terms, shows that while the main effect of employment status remains significant, the interaction between education and employment status provides further nuance. Specifically, the interaction term for High School Graduate:Unemployed is marginally significant, implying that the effect of unemployment on the SVI score may slightly differ for individuals with a high school education compared to others. However, the interaction terms for the other education levels (Some College and College Graduate) with employment status are not statistically significant, suggesting that the relationship between education and SVI score is not strongly influenced by employment status for these groups.

                                Overall, both models suggest that employment status has a notable impact on the SVI score, but the role of education is less pronounced, particularly when considering interactions with employment status. The relatively low R-squared values indicate that the models explain only a small portion of the variance in the SVI scores.

The findings emphasize the importance of addressing educational and employment disparities to reduce social vulnerability. However, policymakers must adopt a holistic approach by incorporating additional factors like healthcare access and transportation equity to craft effective interventions.

                                Individuals with higher education levels, such as "High School Graduate" and "Some College," maintained significantly higher SVI scores compared to those with less than a high school education. However, this relationship diminished for individuals with "Some High School," where the effect was statistically insignificant. Unemployed individuals demonstrated a modest but statistically significant increase in SVI scores compared to employed individuals. No statistically significant interaction effects were identified, suggesting that the impact of education on SVI scores does not vary significantly based on employment status.

These findings support the test hypothesis, as statistically significant relationships were identified between SVI scores, education attainment, and employment status. However, the model's limited explanatory power underscores the complexity of factors influencing social vulnerability.
